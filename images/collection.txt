Initial Dataset Collection Plan
  Images can be taken from either the frame w/ the picam
  or from an iphone at the same fixed dims.
  Take photos at square resolution
  I am thinking that the pictures we need will follow this roughly
    1) For every terrain (background) (~3) {1350}
      2) For every poop object (~3) {450}
        3) For every vertical FOV zone (Size zone) (~5) {150}
          4) For every horizontal FOV zone (angle zone) (~10-~50)
            5) Take a picture (1)
